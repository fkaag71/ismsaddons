 Utilities for a Strata based ISMS documentation

This plugin implements additional macros to support a risk management tool based upon Strata.

For the time being, the names for the significant items are hardwired and in French.
- page data classes risk, scn, mes correspond to risks, scenarios and mitigation measures.
- page param contains data fragments:
  * param#gravite for the risk impact
  * param#vraisemblance for the scenario plausibility
  * param#NiveauRisque for the thresholds of risk levels, computed as risk impact x max (scenarios plausibility)
  * param#CouleurRisque for the color codes corresponding to each risk levels
  * param#Critere for the risk criteria (such as Availabiity, Confidentiality, Integrity)
- within each page with a data class risk
  * property gravit√© is the risk impact, according to the encoding in param#gravite
  * property scenarios lists all scenarios leading to the current risk
- within each page with a data class scn
  * properties V0, VC and VF represent the initial, current and future plausibilities according to selected measures
  * property Mesures lists all measures that could mitigate the current scenario
- within each page with a data class mes
  * property Statut expresses whether the measure is Effective (E), Planned (P) or Not considered (N)
  
Under these conventions:
- macro \~~RISKTABLE~~ presents a matrix of the risks per impact and plausibility, current and future
- macro \~~RISKINDICATORS~~ presents a table with statistics on the risk level per risk criterion
- macro \~~RISKCHECK~~ presents an alert banner depending upon its current page
  * within a page with class scn, if VC < V0 without any effective measure, or VF < VC without any planned measure
  * within a page with class risk, lists all scenarios leading to the risk with such inconsistencies
  * within any other page, lists all scenarios with such inconsistencies
  
A full usage example (in French) has been published in repository https://github.com/fkaag71/smsi-example.
